#🌐 Personal Portfolio Website - Bagus Aji#

A modern, responsive personal portfolio website built to showcase my web development projects and skills.

🚀 Live Demo: [https://revou-fsse-oct25.github.io/milestone-1-bagussam/)]#

This project serves as my digital resume and portfolio. It demonstrates my ability to build responsive web applications using modern frontend technologies like Tailwind CSS and integrate serverless form handling using Google Forms.

#✨ Key Features

##🎨 Modern & Responsive UI

Tailwind CSS Styling: Utilizes a utility-first CSS framework for rapid, pixel-perfect responsive design.

Custom Theme: Features a cohesive "Beige & Bronze" color palette with custom gradients (shiny-brown) and shadows.

Responsive Grid: The project gallery automatically adapts to different screen sizes (Mobile, Tablet, Desktop).

Smooth Navigation: Sticky header with smooth scrolling anchor links and a dynamic mobile sidebar.

##🖼️ Interactive Elements

Lightbox Gallery: Click on project images to view them in a full-screen, darkened modal with a smooth zoom animation.

Hover Effects: Buttons and cards feature subtle lift and shadow transitions for a polished feel.

Protected Assets: Images are protected from easy downloading (right-click and drag disabled).

Parallax Scrolling: Immersive parallax backgrounds on the Home and Contact sections.

##📬 Dynamic Contact System

Smart Form Logic: A dynamic contact form that changes fields based on user intent:

"Leave a Message": Standard name, email, and message fields.

"Request a Meeting": Reveals additional required fields for Date and Time.

Custom Time Picker: User-friendly dual-dropdowns for selecting Hour (01-12) and AM/PM separately.

Google Forms Integration: All submissions are securely sent directly to Google Forms, requiring no backend server maintenance.

##🛠️ Tech Stack

Frontend

HTML5: Semantic structure.

Tailwind CSS: Styling, Grid system, and Responsive Design.
