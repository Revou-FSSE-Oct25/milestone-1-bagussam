🌐 Personal Portfolio Website - Bagus Samudro Aji Luhur

A responsive, modern personal portfolio website built to showcase my web development projects and skills.

This project serves as my digital resume and portfolio. It demonstrates my ability to build responsive web applications using modern frontend technologies like Tailwind CSS and integrate backend services like Google Firebase.

✨ Key Features

🎨 Modern & Responsive UI

Tailwind CSS Styling: Utilizes a utility-first CSS framework for rapid, responsive design.

Custom Theme: Features a cohesive "Beige & Bronze" color palette with custom gradients (shiny-brown) and shadows.

Responsive Grid: The project gallery automatically adapts to different screen sizes using auto-fit grid layouts.

Smooth Navigation: Sticky header with smooth scrolling anchor links.

🖼️ Interactive Elements

Lightbox Gallery: Click on project images or the profile photo to view them in a full-screen, darkened modal with a smooth zoom animation.

Hover Effects: Buttons and cards feature subtle lift and shadow transitions for a polished feel.

Protected Assets: Images are protected from easy downloading (right-click and drag disabled).

📬 Dynamic Contact System

Smart Form: A dynamic contact form that changes based on user intent:

"Leave a Message": Standard name, email, and message fields.

"Request a Meeting": Reveals additional required fields for Date and Time.

Flexible Time Picker: Custom dual-dropdowns for selecting Hour (01-12) and AM/PM separately.

Firebase Integration: All submissions are securely saved to a Google Firestore database in real-time.
